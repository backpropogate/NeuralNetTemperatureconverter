# NeuralNetTemperatureconverter
In this repository I wanted to make a single layer neural network capable of converting Any Input In Celsius to Fahrenheit. 
Its a simple problem actually because of the nature of the problem. in order to convert celsius to fahrenheit you need the following
equation. F= C*1.8+32, The equation to calculate the output value of the layer is a1= x1*w11+b1. 

# Understanding The output Value equation a1 = x1 * w11 + b1
a1 is just the actual Neuron or layer It can be any variable you like.
x1 is just equal to the input and In this case the input would just be the celsius values
Then we multiply that value by w11 which is just the weights
Lastly we have B1 which just stands for the bias


# Comparing the two equations
If you havent noticed by now the temperature converter equation and the output value equation look exactly the same in terms of
structure. This is a rare case because In real world machine learning problems It wont be that easy. In fact most machine learning problems are solved by throwing quasi random neural networks at a particular problem and hoping that the neural network solves and 
it goes without saying that its particular true for unsupervised learning problems.
